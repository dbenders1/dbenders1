# Hi, I'm Dennis ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting this page!

My name is Dennis and I work as a PhD candidate in the [R2C](https://r2clab.com/) and [AMR](https://autonomousrobots.nl/) research labs of the [cognitive robotics department](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/about/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/) at [Delft University of Technology](https://tudelft.nl). I have a strong motivation in developing algorithms to ensure safety during drone flights. My current focus is on robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods for quadrotor planning and control. Besides my research activities, I am very excited about building open-source modular and reproducible robotics software stacks.

Let me know if you are willing to collaborate on the research topic or the implementation side of it!
